# Python CYOAG
My first Python project - A choose your own adventure game! 🐍
---
## 📝 Description
This is a simple text-based game. The user gets introduced to the fantasy world of Midgard, where they are ordered by the king to slay the evil serpeant Jörmungandr. There are many paths that the player can choose, but which ones might lead to victory?  

Alright, I am no writer. Especially not of fantasy, so forgive the simplicity of the story line and all the tropes ripped directly from Norse mythology. However, I did try to make this fun with as much snark as I could add. Plus some fun [ASCII Art](http://www.network-science.de/ascii/) to celebrate a victory or add shame to a loss.  

## 💾 Installation & Usage
Just clone this repo to your local machine and check out the only file, ```app.py```. From a terminal window, navigate to the root directory and run with... 

**Windows:**
```
python app.py
```
**Mac:**
```
python3 app.py
```

## 🔮 Future Development
This is just a whole bunch of branching conditional statements, so it is pretty fragile. Maybe someday when I am feeling bored, it should be broken out into functions where possible. The player's character should be a dictionar. Being able to store the attributes and items like this would make more sense. Also, it is obviously not very dry. Some interactions are repeated and should be in variables.
